# Installation

## Installation Process

Aviation supports both the **Roblox Studio** and [**Rojo**](https://rojo.space/docs/v6/) workflows. It is quite simple and straight forward to install Aviation.

> **NOTE**

__Aviation should always be in *ReplicatedStorage* and the file names should NEVER changed.__


>Visual Studio Code and ROJO Workflow:

+ Download the [*Aviation*](https://github.com/Frieda-VI/Aviation) folder.
+ Insert *Aviation* to your project in Visual Studio Code.
+ Point *Aviation* to [ReplicatedStorage](https://github.com/Frieda-VI/Aviation/blob/main/default.project.json) using ROJO.

> Roblox Studio

+ Get the [*Aviation model*](https://www.roblox.com/library/8014570440/Aviation-V1) on Roblox.
+ Place the *Aviation* model in ReplicatedStorage.
